I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Universidad Nacional de Lanús. I love learning and building creative, productive, and innovative web projects.
I am passionate about Web Development, with a strong focus on Front-End.

🌱 I’m currently mastering:

React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind

⚡ I also have basic knowledge of Node.js and MongoDB.

👯 I’m looking forward to collaborating on open source projects.

✔ Ask me about anything web-related, I’m happy to help if the ball is in my court! 😉

Outside of tech, I enjoy:

🏍️ Riding my motorcycle         🎮 Playing video games         🎵 Listening to music         📺 Watching series         ⚽ Following football
